# 3D-MR
3D Printed Matches Rocket


## Initial Test
Before creating this repository, the concept was tested.
The intial 3D model is creating using Autodesk Fusion.

Below is a video of the initial test launch

Please note that this tested rocket model was up-scaled in the slicing software with a factor of 1.5 (I have done different scalings and that seemed the best)



## Objective
To create fun to use rockets which are primarly thrusted by matches.
Many sources in the internet can be found for rockets with aluminium foil and a single head of matches which when ignited thrusts the rockets.

Here, I am creating a 3D printed version which offers the below:
* Reusability
* More precise shaping to maximize the thrust and reduce air drag.


## Ultimate Goal
Ultimatley, I would like to make a rocket which can lift to 20M
Have a payload of: 
* Umbrella (landing)
* Arduino (as a controller)
* Tiny sensors (for science)
* Servo ("try to" control landing location)
